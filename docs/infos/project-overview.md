# Project Overview: South Cotabato Convergence Data Bank

## Introduction

The South Cotabato Convergence Data Bank is a government transparency and project monitoring portal designed to track the implementation of development projects in vulnerable communities (Sitios) within South Cotabato Province. The system focuses on the "CATCH-UP" mechanism to identify, report, and resolve project delays.

## Core Entities

### 1. Sitios (Communities)

The fundamental unit of the system.

- **Data Points**: Population, households, demographics (poverty incidence, employment rate), and access to basic utilities (water, electricity).
- **Purpose**: To identify beneficiary communities and track development impact over time.

### 2. Projects

Development initiatives linked to specific Sitios.

- **Types**: Infrastructure, social services, etc.
- **Key Attributes**: Budget, timeline, status, and implementing partners.

## Business Processes

### 1. Project Planning & Baseline

Before implementation, a project is defined with a **Baseline**:

- **Schedule**: Planned start and end dates, duration.
- **Budget**: Allocated funds.
- **Phases & Milestones**: The project is broken down into phases (e.g., Pre-Procurement, Construction) and specific milestones with target dates.

### 2. Implementation & Monitoring

The system tracks the ongoing status of projects against the baseline.

- **Physical Progress**: Actual vs. Planned percentage (Slippage).
- **Financial Monitoring**: Tracking allotments, obligations, and disbursements.
- **Employment**: Recording job creation (male/female) generated by the project.

### 3. Delay Management (CATCH-UP Mechanism)

A critical feature for addressing project slippage.

- **Delay Reporting**: When a milestone is missed, a `Delay` record is created.
  - **Root Cause Analysis**: Categorizing delays (weather, material shortage, permit issues, etc.).
  - **Impact Assessment**: Estimating schedule and cost impact.
- **Recovery Actions**: "Catch-up plans" are formulated to mitigate delays.
  - **Action Items**: Specific steps to get back on track.
  - **Target Dates**: Deadlines for recovery actions.
  - **Effectiveness**: Tracking if the recovery action actually reduced the delay.

### 4. Accountability

Ensuring responsible parties are identified.

- **Roles**: Project Manager, Contractor, Technical Lead, Oversight Committee.
- **Escalation**: Defined contacts for technical and administrative issues.

### 5. Transparency & Public Access

- **Public Portal**: Citizens can view project maps, status dashboards, and detailed project profiles.
- **Geo-tagging**: Projects are mapped to their specific Sitio coordinates.

## User Roles

### Administrator

- **Management**: Full CRUD access to Sitios, Projects, and Users.
- **Monitoring**: Updates progress, reports delays, and manages catch-up plans.
- **Data Import**: Bulk import capabilities for legacy data.

### Public User

- **View Access**: Interactive map, project lists, and analytics dashboards.
- **Transparency**: Access to project details, including delays and recovery plans (fostering accountability).
